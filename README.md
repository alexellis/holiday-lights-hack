> A holiday lights hack using the NeoPixel (WS2812 / WS2812b) from AdaFruit

Here we have a smart light which will only run when it detects your presence in the room through a passive infrared PIR sensor. This means you can leave it plugged in all day and night and never have to worry about turning it off or shutting it down. The code in this respository is set to a 10-minute timeout.

**The build**

For the build I used hot glue for the fixings and an 8-LED NeoPixel strip connected to port 18 on the Pi

Fork/Star or clone all the code and the Dockerfile right here.
